# Redis Sails/Waterline Adapter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vanetix/sails-redis.png)](https://travis-ci.org/vanetix/sails-redis)

*Note: This adapter is under active development, and most functions are currently extremely inefficient.*

A Sails/Waterline adapter for Redis. May be used in a [Sails](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails) app or anything using Waterline for the ORM.

This `waterline-redis` stores indexes of unique attributes for *relatively* fast lookups. Collections with multiple unique constraints will create multiple index sets.

In the near future, `sails-redis` will be available on npm.

## About Waterline

Waterline is a new kind of storage and retrieval engine.  It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs.  That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in mySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.
